⚠️ AI INSTRUCTIONS – READ FIRST

Before taking any action, always follow these steps:

Read this [README.md](mdc:README.md) to understand the high-level project structure.

Read the module-level README in the relevant folder before modifying any code. (each module will have it's own README)

Do not create or edit files unless they follow the architecture and contracts described in the READMEs.

When in doubt, ask or leave a placeholder comment instead of guessing.
